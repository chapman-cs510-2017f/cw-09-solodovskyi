    "## Problem 6\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm used in the C function int factorial(int n), the first step is to input an argument n, then follow the steps below: \n",
    "  1. set n equal to a variable fac;\n",
    "  2. check whether n is greater than 0 or not; if n is greater than 0, go to the next step;\n",
    "  3. n=n-1;\n",
    "  4. set fac=fac*n;\n",
    "  5. keep looping step 3 and step 4 until n=0, and then exit the loop;\n",
    "  6. return the value of variable fac.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The two problems with the current function definition can be:\n",
    "  1. when n=1, it will get into the while loop, because 1>0. Then n=n-1, which is 0. Then fac0 will equal to 0. So n-- should be after fac = n;\n",
    "  2. when n >= 0, n should be initialized to 1; otherwise n should be -1(Means error)\n",
    "  \n",
    "The first problem can be fixed by putting n-- before fac=n would return all the factorial as zero. Since when the while loop runs its last round, n=1 and n-- would give n=0, which makes the fianl value for factorial zero. So n-- should go after fac=n.\n",
    "For the second problem, after switching the sequence of n-- and fac=n, it makes no sense to set the initial value fac=n and then do the first round while loop as fac=facn=n*n. So the initial value of fac should be one.\n"
